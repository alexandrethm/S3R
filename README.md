Experiments are done on the DHG 14/28 dataset.
- The `code_S3R` directory contains the actual code of our models.
- The `jupyter_nb` and `scripts` directories contains code used to execute the models, save the results and analyze them
- The `report` directory contains the sources for the report (pdf version can be found [here](report/main.pdf))
